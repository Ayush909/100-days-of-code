# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 30, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about closures, garbage collectors, temporal dead zones, block scope in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Getting my basics straight with some advance javascript concepts. Struggled a bit with temporal dead zones, had to refer some more articles. Would need more practice.
