# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: November 30, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about closures, garbage collectors, temporal dead zones, block scope in Javascript.

**Thoughts:** Getting my basics straight with some advance javascript concepts. Struggled a bit with temporal dead zones, had to refer some more articles. Would need more practice.


### Day 2: November 1, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Learnt about Callbacks, Event Loop, Microtask Queue, Callback Queue, web apis,Blocking of Main thread in Jjavascript

**Thoughts:** Got to learn some new things like console, setTimeout, fetch() are actually web apis. Microtask queue has higher priority than callback queue. Been a good learning day :)
